style	Barleywine	Snifter	Shares some similarities with stouts?					
style	Stout	Snifter	Tasty. Also, look, I know there are multiple types, but it's the thick, oily ones or bust.					
style	IPA	Tulip	Generally fine, but there are too many of these. Also, not going to worry about New England or double or whatever for now.					
style	Fruited Sour	Tulip	Generally more insteresting than IPAs. Not sure about the difference between this and, say, a wile ale.					
style	Blonde Ale	Pint	Can't think of a good example of this.
